# n8n AI Automation Collection

A growing collection of powerful n8n workflows that automate real-world problems using multi-agent AI systems. These automations solve time-consuming tasks across various industries with intelligent, ethical approaches.

## Repository Structure

Each automation is organized in its own folder with complete documentation:

```
automation-name/
├── README.md          # Complete setup guide
├── workflow.json      # n8n workflow file
└── examples/         # Sample inputs/outputs (optional)
```

Browse the repository folders to discover available automations and their specific use cases.
